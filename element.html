        <p>It is generally said that a good website is interesting enough to attract users, makes them feel good when they visit the 
            website, and allows the visitors to find easily what they want and need. There are some elements that determine whether a 
            website is good or not. </p>

    <section id="purpose">
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Establishing a <strong>clear aim of the development of a website </strong>and keep that in mind is the first step
                 which is important to making a great website by asking the question about accomplishment with 
                 the webpage.</p> <br>
    </section>

    <section id="content">
        <h3>Content</h3>
            <p><strong> The most important element of a website is content</strong> because the ultimate purpose of designing a 
                fancy website is to improve the presentation of the content on a website. <em>Relevant</em> and <em>fresh</em> 
                content engages the visitors by building their interests and gaining attention. Also, the 
                information the website provides need to be <em>unique</em> to be distinguished from other websites. 
                It is better to create <em>original</em> content rather than using someone else’s.</p> <br>
    </section>
        
    <section id="structure">
        <h3>Organisation and Structure</h3>
            <p>A <strong>clear and well-organised structure </strong>is one of the essential conditions for making a good website 
                because it contributes to user accessibility and user-friendliness. A structure of a website 
                which is created thoughtfully will have a positive impact on the ability to navigate and find 
                information on the website so that users can gain content they required. One of the ways to 
                organise the contents on the website can be grouping, which helps a website builder to start to 
                construct his or her website easily by classifying relevant content.</p> <br>
    </section>

    <section id="navigation">
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p><strong> Simple navigation to provide intended content </strong>is one of the important elements that compose a 
                high-quality website, which usually provides a user-friendly and <em>intuitive</em> navigation bar. In 
                other words, a successful design of navigation allows the website visitors to find and take the 
                information they wanted quickly and easily. One of the reasons for the importance of navigation 
                is that valid navigation produces better SEO so that it makes search engines to index the 
                website, and another reason is that navigation can improve the usability of the website by 
                letting visitors find a way to reach the information they want. <br>
                Clear navigation should allow users to be able to go any webpage in a website within three 
                clicks. If a website fails to include an intuitive navigation bar, users need to put effort 
                to find what they want, and finally get frustrated and leave.</p> <br>

    <section id="design">
        <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>The good design of a website is <strong>modern and beautiful</strong> that is usually <strong>aesthetically pleasing</strong>, 
                which represents the personality of the website uniquely. Also, the visual prettiness of a 
                website plays an important role in the website such as affecting conversion rate, which means 
                the rate at which the website visitors take the intended action of the website, and providing 
                trustworthiness of the website. Moreover, <em>consistency</em> across the entire site is an important 
                consideration in designing a website.  
            </p> 

        <section id="color">
            <h4>Colour</h4>
            <p><strong>Colours in fonts and background</strong> have an impact on perception of main agent of a website such as 
                an organisation of the website or website designer. Because each colour conveys 
                different emotions, choosing appropriate colours by psychology will help visitors feel good. 
                Plus, <strong>colour contrast</strong> has a large impact on visitor’s feeling about the website. For instance, 
                using dark colours in both background and text does not provide readability, such as text in dark 
                blue and black background; or white background and light-yellow text. <br>
                It is generally good to use maximum three colours by employing colour codes and two fonts 
                style in design.

        <section id="uxd">
            <h4>User experience design</h4>
            <p>It is important in designing a website to consider the user’s experience . User experience design (UXD) means designing a 
                user interface (UI) by considering the information structure and interaction between users and services so as to enhance 
                the satisfaction that users feel when they encounter the services.<br>
                One activity to make an outstanding website is to design a website to be compatible with both desktop and mobile devices. 
                Another one is to take all audience including disabilities such as those with colour-blind conditions into account.

        <section id="image">
            <h4>Image</h4>
            <p>Good images provide an explanation of a key point in content and visitors’ eyes with a break so that they add values to 
                users. Besides, images in high resolution improve visitors’ trust in a website. Containing too many images even big size, 
                however, slows the site down. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the website use images with a purpose in good 
                condition.

                sections by titling headings that represent the topic or keywords of the containing information and breaking into smaller 
                blocks of paragraphs to allow the visitors to understand the divided contents.

    <section id="technology">
        <h3>Web Technologies</h3>
        <p>Not only the users of a website but programmers who are going to read the code written to make the website needs to be 
            considered in making a good website. Basically, <strong>the code of a good website should be correct, clean, not old-fashioned, 
            and not deprecated</strong>. Messy and wrong code can cause some problems when a website renders the browser to execute HTML 
            code to show contents such as text, images, or videos. Validating code will enhance the capability of a web browser 
            such as fasten the loading time, and make easier to find an exact point generating an error in the code in a short time, 
            which contributes to saving time to discover and fix a problem.

                user is such as a different screen size or platform. In other words, a responsive website works well on any screen and device 
                such as mobile-friendliness.  
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="fast">
            <h4>Fast load speed</h4>
            <p>Speed to load the contents; such as graphics, video, or audio; is regarded as one of the main considerations when a visitor 
                decides whether he or she stays on the website or leaves because of delay after clicking on the website. One of the ways to 
                improve the website loading speed is to use adaptive images to reduce the time of taking up bandwidth.

            <h4>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h4>
