        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, there is a large number of websites and pages on the Internet, 
            including both good websites and poorly designed websites. Also, most 
            businesses in the world essentially develop and provide services through 
            their websites. There is no doubt that it is essential - at least it 
            would be better - to use web technology; typically making a pleasing website. <br>
            <br>Although it is rarely said that there is a perfect website that has totally 
            unique and correct content, wonderful design, and always perfectly working 
            functionalities, web developers try to accomplish the ideal goal, which helps 
            them to make a better website.
